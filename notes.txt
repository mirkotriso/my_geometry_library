- define infinite lines and planes
- define distance from lines and planes
- define segments and polygons
- wrap with shapely for polygons (complicated otherwise)
- add all the different checks:
	- orientation of points
	- point inside or outside
- add collections of points to easily define groups of points
- add basic geometries both 2d and 3d
